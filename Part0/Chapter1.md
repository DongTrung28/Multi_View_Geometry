A Tour of Multiple View Geometry


1.1 The ubiquitous projective geometry
- Angles, distance, shape, ratio of distances are not preserved in projective transformation
- Only straightness is preserved
- Projective transformation of a plane as any mapping of the points on the plane that preserves straight lines
